### Project
This project was used to construct a RNN in Keras that could predict drum sequences. 

### Notes
* Final model weights and configurations of the models used in the paper are stored in the `results` folder.
* Link to GUI repository: https://github.com/dosier/nn-drum-synth-gui (lacks setup instructions)

### TODOs
- add authors
- add abstract
- improve code documentation
